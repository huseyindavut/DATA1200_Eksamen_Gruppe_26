                <h1>ACCESSIBILITY</h1>
                <p class="topic">
                    Accessibility refers to the fact that the web is available to everyone and 
                    provides equal access to people of different abilities. In the UN Convention
                    on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, it is emphasized that access to 
                    information and communication technologies is a fundamental human right. 
                    This aims to enable individuals to use the web effectively in many vital 
                    areas such as education, work, health, and shopping <a 
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_
                    Disabilities">(Wikipedia, 2023)</a>. 
                </p>
                <p class="topic"> Accessibility is not only for people with disabilities, 
                    but also for a wide range of people, such as the elderly, 
                    those living in rural areas, and people in developing countries. 
                    Thanks to the accessibility of websites, you can reach these different 
                    groups and make their lives easier.
                </p>
                <p class="topic">For this reason, while building our site, we tried to design a website 
                    where the user can easily access the site, download the content of the 
                    site in the right format and at the best download speed, and easily 
                    understand the data or information on the site. This plugin checked 
                    our site and evaluated it in terms of performance and accessibility, 
                    and told us how to improve. Below we have described some of the factors 
                    that affect the most review scores.

                <h1>IMAGE</h1>
                <p>During this study, first of all, we saw that the data in image format 
                    is very important. We have seen that both the extension format of the 
                    image (i.e. the extension) and the data size of the image file are very 
                    important. For example, we first uploaded the images in .jpeg format and 
                    in the accessibility test, the performance was 89% and the accessibility 
                    was 88% (Figure 1). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a figure below what it should have been. 
                    Later, the «lighthouse» plugin showed us that we could potentially save 
                    1,279.2 KiB by changing the extension of image formats (Figure 1). 
                    As we learned from the Webutvitling lessons, we re-uploaded our images 
                    by converting them to .webP format. Thus, we saw that the performance 
                    increased by 7% (Figure 2).

                  <p class="topic">
                    In cases where pictures cannot be shown, it is important to have 
                    an alternative text (bottom)  in the area covered by the image as 
                    a solution. When creating the Pilestredet 32 page, we did not annotate 
                    the image first. As such, we got a value of 84% from the accessibility 
                    test (Figure 3). 
                </p>
                <p class="topic">
                    We then fixed this problem and added an alternative text (alt="Menu") 
                    and tested it again, and the result value increased by 12% (Figure 4). 
                    This showed us how important the explanations made to the pictures are.

                        larger or smaller or mobile-friendly. When we wrote the images or text 
                        on the page on fixed pixels, we experienced distortions in dynamic 
                        movements (Figure 5).

                    Since there was no flexibility in our first design, when we tested 
                    the «lighthouse» plugin again, the desktop values were normal, while 
                    the mobile performance value was 76% and the accessibility value was 92%. 
                    Later, we made the image and text content suitable for mobile use with 
                    «@media screen» codes. In this new case, we have seen that the performance 
                    value of the «lighthouse» plugin has increased by 95% from the test (Figure 5).

                    We wrote the navigation bar of the page in yellow. We also planned 
                    the background in another shade of yellow. Later, when we put it to the 
                    test, we found that the accessibility rating was 84% (Figure 7). 
                    This reduced the readability and comprehensibility of the article. 
                    For this reason, the test value was low. To address this, we redesigned 
                    the background to be black and contrasted it. In this new case, 
                    the accessibility value increased by 6% (Figure 8). <a href="https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.8/color-contrast">(Deque University, 2023)</a>

                 <p class="topic">
                    When designing the web, the order of the titles given to the articles 
                    is important. For example, a text that starts with the h1 tag, which has 
                    the largest font value, should continue as h2, h3, h4. Disruption of this
                    hierarchical ranking negatively affects the accesibility value. 
                    In this way, the structure of the page becomes confused and it becomes 
                    difficult for the reader to read and understand the written information. 
                    It may cause the user to skip some information while navigating the page.
                    It also becomes more difficult for web browsers to view the page. 
                    For this reason, this hierarchical order must be followed. 
                    While we were designing our own web, we tried to act in accordance 
                    with this order (Figure 9).

                    Finally, as a result of the improvements on our site, it has received a 
                    score of over 90% of the performance and acccesibility values 
                    in mobile and web browser tests. As a result of the interim tests 
                    we conducted during this assignment process, we learned that there 
                    are many issues that will increase performance and accessibility values, 
                    and as we correct them, our site can serve users better.
