                        <p class="topic">Today the global infrastructure of the internet is, to a large degree, dependent on physical sub-sea and underground cables. 
                            Despite the global nature of the internet, the very fact that it relies on physical cables makes its flow of information sometimes subject to national borders. 
                            One recent example of this is the new Norwegian E-Law (2020), which propose that the intelligence service can monitor and 
                            collect all data that goes across the national border. </p>
                            <p class="topic"> As society becomes increasingly digitalized, internet cables can also be seen as critical infrastructure. 
                                Internet cables, both in the North-Sea and of the coast of Taiwan is suspected to have been deliberately sabotaged. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="topic">An estimated 2,5 billion people in the world do not yet have access to the internet. To overcome the physical limitations of internet cables, 
                                companies like Starlink and the EU are working on providing internet access through satellites. Elon Musk’s Starlink is 
                                today the largest global provider of satellite internet with over 4,500 satellites in orbit. They expect to have 42,000 
                                new ones in orbit in the coming years</p>
                        <p class="quoteBar">If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</p>
                        <p class="topic">It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.</p>
                        <p class="topic">Because of our study within computer technology, we are dependent on the internet and not only us within this study, 
                            but according to data report there are a total of 5.30 billion people on the globe 
                            who use the internet and with 2% this number is getting bigger and bigger every year. 
                            Thus, by using satellite internet, the internet will be available to countries that 
                            today do not have access, which is very important if you want to have easy communication 
                            across other countries.

                        <p class="topic">The establishment of the internet via satellites could lead to a reduction in the impact on nature. If a new large internet cable is to be laid, 
                            they could lead to encroachment on nature, internet via satellites avoids this. To protect the cables, they are often buried on the seabed. 
                            This can disturb the nearby ecosystem in a negative way

                                Satellite technology has further facilitated the development of cloud computing, allowing data to be securely stored in the cloud and accessed from any internet-connected device. 
                                This has also revolutionized the way businesses and individuals manage and share data, fostering greater global connectivity and collaboration.
