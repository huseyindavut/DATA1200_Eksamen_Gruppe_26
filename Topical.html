                <h1>TOPICAL</h1>
                <p>Today the global infrastructure of the internet is, to a large degree, dependent on physical sub-sea
                    and underground cables.
                    Despite the global nature of the internet, the very fact that it relies on physical cables makes its
                    flow of information sometimes subject to national borders.
                    One recent example of this is the new Norwegian E-Law (2020), which propose that the intelligence
                    service can monitor and
                    collect all data that goes across the national border. </p>
                <p> As society becomes increasingly digitalized, internet cables can also be seen as critical
                    infrastructure.
                    Internet cables, both in the North-Sea and of the coast of Taiwan is suspected to have been
                    deliberately sabotaged.
                </p>
                <p>An estimated 2,5 billion people in the world do not yet have access to the internet. To overcome the
                    physical limitations of internet cables,
                    companies like Starlink and the EU are working on providing internet access through satellites. Elon
                    Musk’s Starlink is
                    today the largest global provider of satellite internet with over 4,500 satellites in orbit. They
                    expect to have 42,000
                    new ones in orbit in the coming years</p>

                <p class="quoteBar">If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
                    anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet
                    tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.
                </p>
                <p>It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures,
                    to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.</p>
                <p>Because of our study within computer technology, we are dependent on the internet and not only us
                    within this study,
                    but according to data report there are a total of 5.30 billion people on the globe
                    who use the internet and with 2% this number is getting bigger and bigger every year.
                    Thus, by using satellite internet, the internet will be available to countries that
                    today do not have access, which is very important if you want to have easy communication
                    across other countries.
                <p>The establishment of the internet via satellites could lead to a reduction in the impact on nature.
                    If a new large internet cable is to be laid,
                    they could lead to encroachment on nature, internet via satellites avoids this. To protect the
                    cables, they are often buried on the seabed.
                    This can disturb the nearby ecosystem in a negative way

                    Satellite technology has further facilitated the development of cloud computing, allowing data to be
                    securely stored in the cloud and accessed from any internet-connected device.
                    This has also revolutionized the way businesses and individuals manage and share data, fostering
                    greater global connectivity and collaboration.
